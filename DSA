.Data Structures can be defined as a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently. 
.It is easier to search for a particular data if it is organized in a proper format.
.Data Structures help a program to minimize the usage of resources such as memory and space.
.Code should be optimised i.e no. of steps involved in completing an operation should be minimum.

Data structures can also be categorized as linear and non-linear. 
. A linear data structure is the one in which elements are arranged in a sequential manner and each element is connected to its previous and
next element. 
. A non-linear data structure is the one in which elements are not arranged in a sequential manner and each element is connected to other
elements through multiple paths.

*Array and linked list can be used to impliment stack and queue.
*Array limitations:
. array can have data of similar type,heterogenous elements cannot be stored in an array.
. array has fixed size, once declared size cannot be changed./ very difficult to change.
. operations(insertion/delet)done on an array are expensive in terms of memory as they require shifting of data and may lead to loss of data.
. The elements of an array are stored in continuous memory locations. If the required number of blocks are not present together in the memory,
  then the array will not be created. 
* If no. of data entries are not known then instead of using arrays, use other DS like linked list etc. depending upon the use case.

TIME COMPLEXITY:-> Measure of how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input data.
. Linear Search -> O(n) ->n - no. of elements
. Binary Search -> O(log n)
